# Convolutional-Neural-Network-Python-without-machine-learning-framework
There are alot of Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) project in Github. But all of them used machine learning framework such as Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch. It won't tell you much about the base of machine learning and you won't know about ML deeply. And if your computer so old to install tensorflow or pytorch, you cannot even run your project.
So that, I make this project to show you how to build a CNN model in Python without ML framework (It only use Numpy, cv2, multiprocessing and some basic library)
